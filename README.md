# Sub-Gaussian
An R code for computing OFI of the sub-Gaussian elliptically alpha-stable distribution.
The arguments for the main function, that is OFI(...), are: X, alpha, Sigma, and Mu defined as follows. 
X     == an n by d matrix of realizations followwing d-dimensional sub-Gaussian elliptically alpha-stable distribution,
alpha == the ML estimator for alpha, that is, the tail index parameter,
Sigma == the ML estimator for dispersion matrix,
Mu    == the ML estimator for location vector.
