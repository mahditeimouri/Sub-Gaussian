# Sub-Gaussian
An R code for computing OFI of the sub-Gaussian elliptically alpha-stable distribution.
The arguments are: 
X     == an n by d matrix of realizations followwing d-dimensional sub-Gaussian elliptically alpha-stable distribution,
alpha == the ML estimator for alpha, that is, the tail index parameter,
Sigma == the ML estimator for dispersion matrix,
Mu    == the ML estimator for location vector.
